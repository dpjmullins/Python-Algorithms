# Python-Algorithms-and-Coding-Problems

This repository contains functions coded for the study of time complexity and big O notation in algorithms in Python.

It also contains some general coding problems.

## Time complexity types covered so far

* Constant runtime
* Linear runtime
* Logarithmic runtime
* Quadratic runtime
